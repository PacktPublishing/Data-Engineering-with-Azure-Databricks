# Chapter 5: Building Real-Time Data Pipelines

## Summary

In this chapter, we will explore the fundamentals of data streaming and how to build real-time data pipelines using Azure Databricks. We will start by understanding what streaming data is and how it differs from traditional batch processing, examining common use cases and when to choose streaming over batch approaches. We will then dive into the different types of streaming - real-time versus near real-time - and learn how to select the right approach for your specific needs. Next, we will explore Apache Spark Structured Streaming capabilities and how Azure Databricks enhances these features with cloud-native integrations, auto-scaling, and enterprise security, including the powerful Autoloader feature for file-based streaming. We will walk through building your first streaming pipeline with hands-on examples using Azure Event Hubs, Blob Storage, and Autoloader for automatic file processing. Finally, we will cover advanced streaming concepts including stateful processing, handling late-arriving data, fault tolerance, and performance optimization techniques for production-ready streaming applications.

- **Machine learning**: Real-time predictions and recommendations

### 2. Types of Streaming: Real-Time vs Near Real-Time (3-4 pages)
**Goal**: Help readers choose the right streaming approach

#### 2.1 Real-Time Streaming
- **Definition**: Process data in milliseconds or seconds
- **Use cases**: Trading systems, emergency alerts, live video
- **Requirements**: Very fast hardware, simple processing
- **Trade-offs**: High cost, complex setup

#### 2.2 Near Real-Time Streaming
- **Definition**: Process data in seconds to minutes
- **Use cases**: Social media feeds, recommendation engines, monitoring
- **Requirements**: Good hardware, can handle some delay
- **Trade-offs**: Lower cost, easier to build

#### 2.3 Choosing the Right Type
- **Questions to ask**:
  - How fast do you need results?
  - How much can you spend?
  - How complex is your processing?
- **Decision framework**: Simple table to help choose

### 3. Azure Databricks and Spark Streaming Capabilities (4-5 pages)

#### 3.2 Azure Databricks Streaming Features
- **Auto-scaling**: Automatically adds resources when needed
- **Integration**: Works with many Azure services
- **Monitoring**: Built-in tools to watch your streams
- **Security**: Enterprise-grade security features

#### 3.3 Common Azure Streaming Patterns
- **Event Hubs to Databricks**: Ingest events from IoT devices
- **Autoloader for File Streaming**: Process files as they arrive in Blob Storage
- **Kafka to Databricks**: Handle high-volume streaming data
- **Databricks to Power BI**: Send results to dashboards

### 4. Building Your First Streaming Pipeline (6-7 pages)
**Goal**: Hands-on example with step-by-step instructions

#### 4.1 Setting Up Your Azure Account
- **Prerequisites**: What you need before starting
- **Creating a Databricks workspace**: Step-by-step guide
- **Setting up data sources**: Event Hubs or Blob Storage

#### 4.2 Writing Your First Streaming Job
- **Reading streaming data**: Simple example with Event Hubs
- **Using Autoloader**: Process files from Blob Storage automatically
- **Basic transformations**: Filter, select, and aggregate data
- **Writing results**: Save to Delta Lake or Blob Storage
- **Complete working example**: Copy-paste code that works

#### 4.3 Monitoring and Debugging
- **Databricks UI**: How to see what's happening
- **Common problems**: What goes wrong and how to fix it
- **Performance tips**: How to make your streams faster

### 5. Advanced Streaming Concepts (6-7 pages)
**Goal**: Cover production-ready features

#### 5.1 Managing Stateful Streaming
- **What is state**: Remembering data between batches
- **When to use state**: Counting, aggregating, joining streams
- **Stateful operations**: `mapGroupsWithState`, `flatMapGroupsWithState`
- **Example**: Building a real-time counter

#### 5.2 Handling Late Data and Fault Tolerance
- **Watermarks**: How to handle late-arriving data
- **Checkpointing**: How to recover from failures
- **Exactly-once processing**: Making sure data is processed once
- **Example**: Processing sales data with late orders

#### 5.3 Performance Optimization
- **Partitioning**: How to split data for faster processing
- **Caching**: How to keep data in memory
- **Resource tuning**: How to set up clusters for streaming
- **Autoloader optimization**: Tuning file processing performance
- **Example**: Optimizing a high-volume stream

## Hands-on

1. `01_streaming_pipeline_with_event_hub.py` - This exercise shows how to build a basic streaming pipeline that reads data from Azure Event Hubs. It covers connecting to Event Hubs using the Spark connector, parsing JSON arrays containing IoT sensor data (device ID, temperature, humidity, pressure, battery, location), and writing the parsed events to a Delta table with proper schema handling and checkpointing.
2. `02_streaming_pipeline_with_autoloader.py` - This exercise demonstrates using Databricks Auto Loader to read JSON files from Azure Blob Storage in a streaming manner. It covers how Auto Loader automatically handles schema inference, schema evolution, tracks processed files, and ingests new files as they arrive in the storage container, while also showing how to use the rescuedDataColumn feature to capture unparsed data for troubleshooting.
3. `03_stateful_streaming_pipeline.py` - This exercise demonstrates advanced stateful streaming operations using watermarks and time-window aggregations. It covers two key patterns: (1) time-window aggregations that calculate statistics (avg, min, max, count) for each device over 5-minute windows, and (2) real-time alert generation that detects threshold violations (critical temperature/battery levels) and writes alerts with severity levels to a separate Delta table for monitoring and notifications.
